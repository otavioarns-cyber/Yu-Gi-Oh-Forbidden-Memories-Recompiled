"""Fusions in bulk: every pair of a set of cards A with a set of cards B.

Each set is chosen by filters that must all hold (card kind, monster type,
attribute, guardian star, ATK, DEF, level, words of the name or the text,
a list of cards, "is a fusion result"). The plan says, before anything
changes, which pairs would be added, which already fuse and are kept or
replaced, and which are left alone; apply() carries it out and returns what
undo() needs to put it back. No Tk here: bulk_dialog.py is the window.

A pair is unordered, as in the game (Duel_CheckFusion sorts the two ids;
the port's rules are kept under the smaller one), so A+B and B+A are one
pair: a pair both sets make twice is counted once, as a duplicate.

"Already fuses" is what the port would do with the rules the project holds
(src/pc/cards/tables.c Tables_Fusion): the pair's own rule, or, for a card
the mod adds, its base's; a rule of 0 forbids the fusion, so that pair
fuses with nothing and bulk add treats it as free.
