"""A mod's "starter_pools" (notes/starter-deck.md): pools of its own for a new
game's deck to be drawn from, in place of writing the forty cards down.

The port reads them in src/pc/cards/starter.c; the checks here are that file's,
so a problem shows in the editor rather than as a line in the Mods window.

The mod.json shape:

    "starter_pools": [
        {"name": "Weak monsters", "draws": 16, "cards": {"Mystical Elf": 100}},
        {"draws": 24, "cards": {"Dark Magician": 1, "My Added Card": 3}}
    ]

Each pool draws its own number of cards from its own weights, and the draws
must add up to the forty a deck holds. A draw spreads a random number over the
pool's weight total and walks its cards until the weights reach it, as the
disc's generator walks a row of its own.

What this does that the disc's rows cannot: the disc keeps 722 weights of a
fixed width and reads only the first 720, so no weight of its own can name a
card a mod added. A pool here names cards the way the rest of a manifest does,
so a mod's own are weighted like any other.

A written deck still wins: the port asks for one first, then for these, and
reads the disc's rows only when neither is offered.

The editor keeps the section in Project.other["starter_pools"] as written; the
Starter decks tab turns it into `Pool`s (`read`) and back (`build`).
