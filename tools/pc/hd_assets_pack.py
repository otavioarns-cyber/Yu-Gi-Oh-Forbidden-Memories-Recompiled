"""Turn a folder of redrawn HD card assets into a texture pack.

The assets are drawn to their own layout, not the game's; this tool knows
where each goes on the disc and in which palettes the game draws it:

Card names are not taken from the assets: the port draws every card's plate
from its name (src/pc/cards/art.c), the base cards' and the ones mods add
alike, so they stay one style.

  cards/<n>.png        card n's art (102x96 texels), and its 40x32
                       thumbnail (the duel hand, sector n-1), cut from the
                       art where the game's own thumbnail is cut from the
                       game's art (--thumb-crops, found once by search)

                       the card-frame sheet (two 8-bit columns, 256x256
                       texels at 4x), one per palette row 8-11; rows 12
                       and 13 (purple, orange) are the monster frame
                       recoloured as the game's rows recolour it
  backcard/Back.png    the card back, 144x200 pixels as the card view
                       draws it from five pieces (BACK_PIECES): most of it
                       at the foot of the frame sheet's second column and
                       the head of the package's third, its right edge and
                       bottom rows in slices at the head of the second;
                       drawn through every row
  attributes/<a>.png   the attribute balls, 16x16 texels at (16k, 128) of
                       the package's fourth column, ball k through palette
                       row 15 entry 16k: light, dark, earth, water, fire,
                       wind, magic, trap
  levels/star.png      the level star, 9x9 at (0, 144) of that column
  stats/stats.png      the digits, the three [... Card] labels, ATK and
                       DFD: split into its groups, each fitted to the
                       pixels of the game's own

The frame sheet is the same words in ten packages (Build Deck, Library,
Password and the seven duel terrains), and so are the back's foot and the
fourth column's pieces; each package has its own palette block at (256,
240) whose rows 8-15 are the same. Every copy gets the entries.

The labels are drawn subtracted from the frame (their palette entries 1-7
carry the semi-transparency bit, which a pack pixel keeps from the original
texel): over those texels a letter is written as the grey that subtracts to
dark (blend_ready), elsewhere as it is.

--base takes an existing pack (hd_screen_pack.py's output; repeat it for
several): a reading it has starts from its image, the assets drawn over it,
and its other entries join the part its recipe names. --merge adds another
pack's entries as they are (a portraits mod). The result is one mod, in
parts the player can switch off in the Mods window (PARTS; each merged pack
is a part of its own, named as that mod is).

Usage: hd_assets_pack.py --assets <folder> --out <mod folder> [--data game/DATA]
                         [--base <pack> ...] [--merge <pack> ...] [--thumb-crops crops.json]
