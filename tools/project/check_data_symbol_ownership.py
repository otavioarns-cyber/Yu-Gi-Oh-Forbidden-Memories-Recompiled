"""Check that no C data definition collides with a linker-script assignment.

A symbol can be given an address in `c_symbols.ld` *and* defined in a C
translation unit. The assignment wins, the definition never loads, and the
source then describes storage the image does not take from it. The byte-exact
build cannot see this: the bytes still come from somewhere, so the executable
matches and nothing complains. Every data carve has therefore had to be
checked by hand, symbol by symbol.

That is what this automates. For each unit in `data_c.json` it reads the
initialized definitions out of the source and reports any whose name is also
assigned in a linker script.

It deliberately does **not** report tentative definitions -- a global written
without `extern` and without an initializer, which the compiler emits as a
common symbol. Those look like exactly the same mistake and are not one. The
spelling is a deliberate `-G` lever: a common symbol is placed in small data
and addressed through `$gp`, and writing `extern` instead moves it. Twelve
of them exist today. Rewriting three more in `Fade_Update` -- whose profile
`gcc_2_8_1_cc_g8_as_g1_split_comm` was named for this very property -- shrank
the executable from 0x1D0800 to 0x1D07F4 bytes; it now builds as matching C
inside `fade_runtime.c` under `gcc_2_8_1_g8_split_comm`. A check that flagged them would
report twelve defects, all of them load-bearing, so it reports none.

The distinction is the point: an *initialized* definition that duplicates an
assignment is inert and wrong, and an *uninitialized* one is how several units
reach small data at all.

    tools/environments/python/bin/python \\
        tools/project/check_data_symbol_ownership.py

The default reads sources, needs no build, and covers the units in
`data_c.json` -- the place carves happen and the place the mistake is most
likely. `--objects` reads the symbol tables of everything already compiled
instead, which is authoritative and covers ordinary translation units too,
at the cost of needing a build first. Across every object the only
collisions today are the twelve common symbols above, so it currently
passes; it is a regression gate rather than a repair.
