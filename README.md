# Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories Recompiled

**Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories** (PS1, USA) rebuilt from its decompiled source as a
native PC game for Windows and Linux. Bring your own disc image; no game data is
included but the text of the European translations (below).

## Play

Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/Unchiga/Yu-Gi-Oh-Forbidden-Memories-Recompiled/releases),
extract it and run `memories-pc.exe` (Windows) or `./memories-pc` (Linux). On first
launch, pick your USA disc's `.bin`. The game can tell you when a newer release is out
(**Help > Check for updates at start** turns it off; see [Updates](notes/updates.md)).

### HD pack

1. From the same release, download `yfm-redecomp-hd-mod-<version>.zip`.
2. Close the game and extract the zip into the game folder, the one with `memories-pc.exe`
   or `memories-pc`. You should end up with `mods/assets-hd` beside the other mods.
3. Start the game. The pack is on by default: press **F10** for the menu bar and open
   **Game > Mods** to check it, or to turn it or any of its parts off.
4. For the best look, pick **Video > Resolution > Internal 4x** and turn on **Video > HD text**.

**From source:** put the `.bin` in `game/` and run `play.bat` or `./play.sh`. The first
run builds everything (Linux needs `gcc` and `python3`). See [PC build](notes/pc-build.md).

**Languages:** `languages/*.txt` is the text of the five European releases, read off the
PAL discs by the port itself. With the discs in `game/pal`, `python3 tools/pc/export_languages.py`
writes them again, and `--check` compares them ([Translations](notes/translation.md),
"The official languages"). They are the only game data in the repository: text, no pictures.

## Decompilation

Every game function matches the original executable byte for byte:

```sh
make tools   # pinned toolchain
make match   # rebuild SLUS_014.11 exactly (see notes/setup.md)
```
