# More cards than the disc has

The PC port can have any number of cards past the disc's 722, up to card id
32766. A mod adds them with a `cards` list in its `mod.json`, and they work
wherever a card does: the Library, Build Deck, duels (the hand, the field, the
3D battle, fusions, equips, rituals and card effects), duel rewards, the card
viewer, saves, save states, trading and two-player duels.

Each new card starts as a **copy** of a retail card, its *base*. Model, effect
and fusion defaults come from that card, but entries can specify independent
`model`, `effect` and `fusions` values. Managed code hooks can implement new
behavior; see [Mod API 3](mod-api-3.md). Everything a player reads off the card
can be its own: name, artwork, card text, ATK, DEF, type, guardian stars,
level and attribute. What a mod leaves out is the base's. The disc has none
of these cards, so wherever the game goes to the disc, or to a table laid out
by the disc, it asks for the base instead, and lays the card's own art and
text over what comes back.

The release ships no card mod; the checks below were made with test mods
(a thousand made-up names, and a card with its own picture).

## The manifest

```json
{
    "id": "wacky",
    "name": "Wacky cards",
    "cards": [
        { "copy": "Kuriboh", "name": "Dingus Shmingus", "art": "images/dingus.png",
          "description": "A round and cheerful fellow who has never once been on time.",
          "type": "Beast", "attribute": "Fire", "level": 7, "stars": ["Moon", "Venus"],
          "attack": 2500, "defense": 2100 },
        { "copy": 1, "name": "Shmungus Mingus", "description": "Blue-eyes' cousin from out of town." },
        { "copy": "Kuriboh", "count": 100, "count_setting": "count", "name": "Kuriboh {n}",
          "drops": false, "opponents": true }
    ]
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `copy` | the base: a retail card id (1-722) or its name as the game spells it (`"Kuriboh"`, any case) |
| `count` | how many cards this entry adds (default 1) |
| `count_setting` | read `count` from one of the mod's settings instead, so `MEMORIES_MOD_<ID>_COUNT=5000` or `mod.<id>.count=5000` in the settings file changes it without editing the manifest |
| `name` | the cards' own name; `{n}` is the card's number within the entry and `{id}` its card id. Without one a card has its base's name. Letters, digits, spaces and ``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:<>?`` are what the game's font has; accented letters and others the port adds ([translations](translation.md)) work too |
| `description` | the card's own text (UTF-8: accented letters work, [translations](translation.md)), wrapped as the retail texts are (lines of up to twenty letters, broken at spaces; `\n` breaks a line where it stands). The codes the FM Editor shows work too: `{f8 0B NN}` an icon (one letter wide), `{f8 0A NN}` a colour, `{g X}` a glyph by number. Eight lines is the most any retail text has. Without one a card has its base's text |
| `art` | a PNG in the mod (a path relative to its directory): the card's picture and, made from the same image, the small one the hand and field show. Any size: the middle of it at the card's shape is taken and scaled to 102x96 and 40x32, and its colours reduced to the 255 and 63 each has. An image bigger than that is also drawn at its own resolution when View > Console resolution is set above 1x (Internal 2x, 4x), as a texture pack's image is ([HD pictures](#hd-pictures)), so 408x384 (4x) or 816x768 (8x) looks best |
| `thumbnail` | a PNG for the small picture alone, when the scaled-down `art` does not read well at 40x32; bigger than 40x32, it is drawn at its own resolution too |
| `field_art` | a PNG (same sizing rule as `art`) for the 3D Monsters mod's Card art style cutout alone, on top of the card on the duel field: never patched into the card's own record, so the Library, hand, trade screen and detail panel keep showing `art` (or the base's own picture) untouched. Without one the cutout shows the same picture everything else does |
| `title` | a PNG for the name plate at the top of the card's picture (96x14; dark ink on white, or on a transparent background). Without one, a card with its own name gets a plate with that name set in Times at the retail plates' size (Times New Roman on Windows, fontconfig's match for `Times` elsewhere, Liberation Serif on most Linux systems), or a blank plate when there is none |
| `attack`, `defense` | 0 to 5110, in tens, as the game stores them |
| `type` | a number or a name (`"Dragon"`, `"Winged Beast"`). A copy of a monster stays a monster, since it has its base's 3D model; a copy of a magic, trap, ritual or equip card keeps its type, since it has its base's effect |
| `attribute` | a number or a name (`"Light"` to `"Wind"`) |
| `level` | 0 to 12 |
| `stars` | the two guardian stars, as numbers or names (`"Mars"` to `"Venus"`, and a mod's own up to 15: [Guardian Stars](modding.md#guardian-stars-names-icons-new-stars-and-matchups)); a second of `0` (none) or the same as the first is a card with one star |
| `frame` | the colour of the card's frame, whatever its type: `"Monster"` (gold), `"Magic"` (green), `"Trap"` (pink), `"Ritual"` (blue), `"Purple"` or `"Orange"`, or a number 0-5 in that order; `"Type"` goes back to its type's ([below](#frame-colour)) |
| `fusion_groups` | the fusion guides' groups the card is in, for a ritual's `fusion_group` condition ([Gameplay tables](gameplay-tables.md#rituals)): a list such as `["Elf", "Female"]`, `[]` for none; without it, its base's |
| `drops` | whether the card can be won in its base's place (default `true`, below) |
| `opponents` | whether an opponent's deck can be dealt it in its base's place (default `false`) |
| `password` | what View > Card passwords shows for it ([PC build](pc-build.md#card-passwords-view)): up to eight digits as a string (`"08124921"`, leading zeros kept) or a number, `""` or `null` for none. It is only shown: the Password screen does not know it (a disc card's
password and price there are the [gameplay tables'](gameplay-tables.md#passwords-and-prices-on-the-password-screen)
`passwords`, which win over this one in the view). A copy without one shows none (its base's would give the base) |
| `notes` | text of the modder's own, which the game shows and plays by none of ([below](#notes-on-a-card)) |

What an entry leaves out is its base's. Give entries explicit stable `id` keys. Saves use these identities; runtime
IDs are remapped when mods change. Legacy numeric sidecars require explicit
migration as described in [Mod API 3](mod-api-3.md#card-definitions-and-identities).

The mods' `cards` are read in load order, as every other table is
(`priority`, then `after` and `requires`, then the order the mods were
found; the Mods window's Load order), and each mod's entries in the order
they are written. The runtime ids follow each other in that order, so
moving a mod in the load order renumbers the cards added after it for the
run: saves and deck slots keep them by identity (above), and a save state
made with another order is refused, as for any change of the mods' order
([Mod API 3](mod-api-3.md#save-states)). The stats a copy leaves out are its
base's as the entries before it left them: a copy of a card that an earlier
mod in load order replaces has the replacement's stats, a later mod's
replace does not reach them. A name, text or picture it leaves out is its
base's as the game ends up with it, later mods' replaces included. A mod
with `cards` needs a restart to apply or remove, like a data override: the
cards are counted once, when the game starts. The window and the log
(`MEMORIES_TRACE=mods`) say which ids each entry got.

## Changing a card of the disc

`"replace": <id or name>` in place of `copy` changes the retail card itself,
so a mod can rework the existing cards without adding any:

```json
{ "replace": 1, "name": "Bulbasaur", "art": "images/bulbasaur.png",
  "description": "A strange seed was planted on its back at birth.",
  "type": "Plant", "attribute": "Earth", "attack": 1180, "defense": 1150 }
```

It takes the keys above that change what a player reads off the card:
`name`, `description`, `art`, `thumbnail`, `title`, `field_art`, `attack`, `defense`,
`type`, `attribute`, `level`, `stars`, `frame` and `password` (without one it shows
the disc's). It gets no id of its own, so `id`,
`count`, `count_setting`, `drops`, `opponents` and `fusions` do not apply:
the card keeps its place in the disc's tables, and the
[gameplay tables](gameplay-tables.md) change its fusions, equips and rituals.

Unlike a copy, a replaced card may change sides with `type`: a magic, trap,
ritual or equip card can become a monster, and a monster a magic, trap,
ritual or equip card. The disc has 3D models for its monsters only, so a card
made a monster fights without one unless `model` names a monster whose model
it takes (`"model": "Kuriboh"`), and without `stars` it gets that monster's
guardian stars, or the Sun and the Moon. A monster made anything else does
nothing when played unless `effect` names the card whose effect it takes
(`"effect": "Legendary Sword"`); what an equip made so may equip is up to
`equips` in the [gameplay tables](gameplay-tables.md). `model` and `effect`
work the same on a card that stays on its side.

A trap card springs as the trap its `effect` names (`"effect": "Bear Trap"`,
stopping the attacks `trap_thresholds` gives Bear Trap), else as its own. A
card made anything but a trap springs as no trap, even one that was a trap on
the disc.

A card that changes kind (monster, magic, trap, ritual or equip) leaves the
disc's fusion and equip tables, which describe the card it was: it fuses and
equips only by the mods' own rules, and no disc recipe makes it. Otherwise the
CPU would plan with the old card, fusing a monster with what is now a magic
card or taking a monster off the field for what is now an equip, and lose the
cards. An equip made from another kind equips nothing until `equips` says
what. A magic, trap, ritual or equip card has no ATK or DEF, so a monster made
one loses its own, and `attack` or `defense` on it is noted and left out: the
CPU ranks the cards in its hand by them whatever their type, and would set it
face down turn after turn as its best monster.

A replaced piece of Exodia (cards 17 to 21) is an ordinary card: a deck may
hold three of it, and Exodia can no longer be assembled. `"exodia": true`
keeps both rules, for a mod that only changes how the pieces look. Nothing of it goes in the save, so the mod can be
removed at any time (after a restart). A card with a name of its own gets a
plate that says it, as an added card does (a `title` PNG replaces it), and
the HD text renderer sets its title from the same name. Its name and text
win over a [translation](translation.md)'s, and the Library and Build Deck
sort it by the new name. Copies of it that set no name, text or art of their
own show the replaced ones.

When two entries (or two mods) replace the same card, the later one goes over
the earlier: of two mods, the later in load order, whatever their folders
are called. Its stats, stars, level, attribute, type, frame, model and
effect go over the earlier one's where it gives them, and what it leaves out
of those stays as the earlier one set it. Its name (with the plate that says
it), text, password, art, `title`, `field_art` and `fusion_groups` take the
earlier one's place whether it gives them or not: left out, the card's own
come back. Notes add up ([below](#notes-on-a-card)). The Mods window notes
it.

## Frame colour

The game draws a card's frame through a palette its type picks: gold for a
monster, green for magic and equip, pink for a trap, blue for a ritual.
`"frame"` picks one of those for the card whatever its type, or one of the
two the disc has and never uses, purple and orange:

```json
{ "replace": "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", "frame": "Purple" }
```

Only the colour changes: a monster keeps its ATK/DEF and a magic card its
MAGIC word. Left out, a replaced card keeps the frame an earlier mod gave
it and a copy takes its base's; `"Type"` goes back to the type's
(`Cards_FrameColor`, `src/pc/cards/cards.c`). It shows everywhere the game
colours a card by its type:

- the card view (Library, Build Deck, Trade, Password, the duel's card view,
  fusions, rituals and cards being played): `func_800291E0`, palette rows
  8-13 of each package's card-frame sheet;
- the duel's hand and its 2D field cards (`func_80016784`) and the 3D field
  cards (`func_80024C1C`, drawn by `func_80015EF4`): rows 1-6 of the duel's
  hand-frame palette;
- the Library's grid (`library_runtime.c`), whose small cards have a
  palette per frame at x 0x160-0x1B0;
- the 16x16 card icon in Build Deck (`func_80031574`) and Trade
  (`MainMenu_DrawCardTypeIcon`): its package has orange (x 0x2A0) but no
  purple, so a purple card keeps its type's icon there.

The Forbidden Memories HD mod's frames cover purple and orange too
(`tools/pc/hd_assets_pack.py` recolours the monster frame into them).

## Notes on a card

`"notes"` is the modder's: what was changed and why, what is still planned.
The game draws none of it and plays by none of it. The
[FM Editor](../tools/pc/fm_editor/README.md) shows it as the card's **Notes**
box. A `replace` entry with nothing but `notes` (and an `id`) only notes the
card, so a mod can tag the disc's cards, or another mod's changes, without
changing them:

```json
{ "replace": "Dark Magician", "notes": "The main boss card. <burn: 300> <no-fusion>" }
```

A card's notes add up: every entry that gives the card `notes`, in every
applied mod, in load order, a line between two. A later entry that replaces
the card again does not take an earlier one's notes away.

A [code mod](modding.md#code-mods) reads them, from mod API 7, with
`host->card_notes(host, id)` (the whole text, or `NULL`) and
`host->card_tag(host, id, key, out, size)`, which reads tags the way RPG
Maker reads its note boxes:

| Written | `card_tag` of it |
|---|---|
| `<burn: 300>` | `"burn"` gives `"300"` (returns 3, its length) |
| `<no-fusion>` | `"no-fusion"` gives `""` (returns 0) |
| no such tag | returns -1, `out` is `""` |

A tag's name is anything but `<`, `>` and `:`, and any case matches; the
value runs from the first colon to the `>`. Spaces around either do not
count. Of two tags with one name the last counts. Everything outside the
brackets is comment. `out` is cut to fit `size` and always ended; the return
is the value's whole length, as `snprintf`'s, so a longer one can be asked
for again. What the value means (a number, a card name, an identity) is up
to the mod that reads it:

```c
char value[16];
if (host->api >= 7 && host->card_tag(host, card, "burn", value, sizeof(value)) > 0)
    burn = atoi(value);
```

The notes are known once the card tables are built, before the title screen.

## Where a card comes from

The disc's reward and deck tables are of retail cards, and their weights add
up to 2048, so they are not extended. A copy that asks to (`drops`) is won in
its base's place instead: when a duel's reward roll lands on the base, the
game picks evenly among the base and every such copy. The base's family is
won exactly as often as the base was, and without such copies the game's
random numbers go exactly as before. `opponents` does the same for the cards
an opponent's deck is dealt. Starter decks and passwords are the disc's, so a
new card is never in a starter deck and has no password.

`MEMORIES_DEBUG_CHEST=3` (every card, three copies, new ones included) and
`MEMORIES_DEBUG_DECK="723-762"` (the deck, as ids and ranges) are the
development shortcuts; see [pc-build.md](pc-build.md).

## How it is done

The console build is untouched: every change to shared game sources is under
`MEMORIES_PC` or is a named constant that expands to the same number there,
and `make match` and `make match-overlays` reproduce the retail hashes.

**The count.** `CARD_COUNT` stays 722 everywhere the disc is laid out by it (the
art sectors are `(id - 1) * 7 + 722`). `CARD_COUNT_LIVE` (`gCard_nCount`) is
how many cards this run has, and bounds the loops. `CARD_TABLE_COUNT` (32766)
sizes the tables and workspaces indexed by card id
([`card_constants.h`](../src/game/card_constants.h)).

**The tables.** `gDuel_adwCardStats`, `gCard_asNameSortKey` and
`gDuel_abCardLevelAttr` are packed back to back in the executable with room
for 722 cards. The port defines them in
[`src/pc/game/card_storage.c`](../src/pc/game/card_storage.c), a game-side
unit, so the build stops pinning them to the retail addresses, and
`Cards_Build` ([`src/pc/cards/cards.c`](../src/pc/cards/cards.c)) copies the
retail tables in and appends the mods' cards at startup. The same unit holds
everything else that outgrew its console storage: the Library's per-card
display records (`D_800EA1E8`), the Build Deck workspace (two 0x6344-byte
panes at `payload_bases[0]` on the console, `BUILD_DECK_WORKSPACE`), the
trade screen's rows (`D_801845FC`) and the Library cursor, widened from `s8`.
Being game variables, they sit at fixed addresses inside every save state,
which is why a state is now about 7.5 MB.

None of the MIPS code the port runs under its interpreter (the WA effect
bank, the MODEL control modules) addresses these tables: a scan of the WA
bank and all of MODEL.MRG for `lui`-formed addresses found none in
`0x800EA1E8`-`0x800EAD88` or `0x801A0000`-`0x801E0000`.

**The base.** `Cards_BaseId` stands in for the card wherever the disc or a
disc table is behind the id: the big artwork (`func_80029164`), the small
field and hand images (`Duel_RequestCombinedDeckData` reads one sector per
unique *base*, and `Duel_PopulateCombinedDeckData` finds each card's by its
base), the 3D model (`Model_LoadMonsterMerge` from the Library, the battle's
`D_800EF658`: a copy's id could otherwise be 777, `MODEL_SPECIAL_BATTLE_ID`,
Exodia's), the card text (`duel_effect_command.c`), the fusion and equip
tables (`duel_card_checks.c`; an equip answers with the card it was asked
about), rituals (`Duel_CheckRitual`), card effects
(`DuelEffect_StartCardEffect`, so the handlers that test
`gDuel_wEffectCardID` see the base), traps (`Duel_SelectTrapByCardId`,
`duel_trap_resolution.c`) and the AI's damage-card values.

**Ids beside flags.** Build Deck's box rows and the placement result keep a
flag in bit 15 and read the id back with `& 0xFFF`; `CARD_ID_FIELD_MASK` is
`0x7FFF` on the PC port. Card ids themselves are 16 bits everywhere else.

**The trunk and seen marks.** The save's trunk is 722 bytes at +0x50 with 18
bytes to spare before the duelist code, and the Library's seen marks are
campaign flags `0x120 + id`, which reach the password flags at 0x400. So the
new cards' quantities and seen marks are kept by the port: `Cards_ChestSlot`
is the trunk byte of a card in a given save (the running one, the two a
two-player screen loads, or the copies a trade is made on), and
`Cards_Seen`/`Cards_MarkSeen` the seen mark. Every place that reached the
trunk directly goes through them: Build Deck's setup and exit, the Library,
`Library_CheckCardOwned`, `Duel_AwardCard`, the recent-drop compaction,
the trade screen and its commit.

**Beside the save.** A memory card block has no room for them either, so
`cards/<duelist code>.txt` in the user directory holds them, a section per
save sequence (`save <n>`, then `chest2 <identity> <count>`, `seen2 <identity>` and
`deck2 <slot> <old-id> <base> <identity>` lines, then `end`), the newest eight kept. The
game's own save writes one (`SaveData_RequestWrite`, under the sequence the
payload gets), a load reads the one for the loaded sequence
(`SaveData_PollLoad`), a two-player load reads both saves', and a trade
rewrites both once the memory cards took it. NEW GAME is noticed by the
running save's duelist code changing. A save made while no card mod was
applied has no section, and gets the newest earlier one: what the player had
when they last played with the mod. A deck that holds a card the run does not
have (the mod was removed) gets each such slot's base back, from its `deck2`
line, so a duel never deals a card that is not there. Ownership and seen records
for missing mods are retained; returning mods recover them by stable identity.

**Its own art and text.** The game still loads the base's art record
(`func_80029164`) and the base's thumbnail sector
(`Duel_RequestCombinedDeckData`); `Cards_PatchArtRecord`, called in
`func_800289BC` before the four uploads, and `Cards_PatchThumbnail`, called in
`Duel_PopulateCombinedDeckData` after each block is copied, lay the card's own
picture, plate and thumbnail over them
([`art.c`](../src/pc/cards/art.c) makes them from the PNGs: the record layout
is in its header comment and in
[modding-tutorial-evidence.md](modding-tutorial-evidence.md#card-image-editor-dimensions)).
The plate is drawn subtractively over the gold frame through its own fixed
palette: entry 1 takes the most away and is the darkest ink, 7 barely shows,
0 is clear. The retail plates put their stems at 1 with faint 6 and 7
fringes, and a plate that inks with 7 reads as a pale ghost. The generated
plates follow the settings the
[YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesRecomp](https://github.com/yamyi/YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesRecomp)
project measured against window captures (its `psx_card_packs.c`,
`render_title`): Times
regular at 13 pixels, the baseline under row 11, whole-pixel advances,
and a name wider than 90 pixels squeezed into columns 3 to 93 and brought
back up to full ink. Each texel takes the ink of the nearest tone, from
what each ink was measured to take from the gold in the game (`ink_of`);
a retail card a translation renames gets its plate the same way
([translations](translation.md#how-the-port-does-it)). The name is read as UTF-8, as its glyphs are, so an
accented letter is one character on the plate too; one the font lacks is
left out. An entry's cards share one plate unless the name has `{n}` or
`{id}` in it. A patched picture and thumbnail are reported written
(`TextureDump_Written`), so a texture pack's picture of the base card does
not show through on the copy in words that happen to match it; the plate
is not, since that write would drop the delivery of the sector that also
ends the base's palette. Card text goes in beside the name, at the text
engine's insert command (`duel_effect_command.c`, op 0x40).

<a id="hd-pictures"></a>**HD pictures.** A texture pack finds its images by where their
bytes came from on the disc, and a mod card's picture comes from no place on
the disc, so the port registers the PNG itself: for an `art` or `thumbnail`
bigger than the console's picture, `Cards_Build` hands the record's made
bytes (the picture, 51 words by 96 rows at 8 bits, and its 256-entry CLUT;
the thumbnail, 20 by 32, and its 64 entries) and the PNG's crop (the same
middle `resample` takes, `CardArt_Crop`) to `TexturePack_AddMade`. Each
distinct block of bytes gets a place of its own from `TEXTURE_MADE_BASE`
(0xC0000000, past any CD) up, and the pack's recall index knows it by its
bytes: the upload of a patched record has no disc provenance (the patch
reported it written), so `TextureDump_Loaded` asks `recall`, which checks
the whole block, and the words are tagged with the made place. From there
it is a pack entry like any other: painted into the shadow, resampled at
1x, sampled at its own resolution above it by both renderers, found again
after a state load (`rediscover` compares against the made bytes). A made
block's first 32 bytes may be one value (a plain sky); only a block of one
value throughout is left out, as a fill would match it anywhere. Made
entries are kept apart from the packs' and joined to them again whenever
the packs are unloaded or reloaded, so enabling or disabling a texture pack
in the Mods window keeps them. Entries with the same art share one entry;
two pictures with the same palette share the palette's place. Nothing in the
mod's manifest changes: a mod written for 0.1.2 gets HD pictures from the
PNGs it already has, and one at 102x96 draws as before.

**What spells out 722.** The Library's heading string (`"<seen/722>"`,
0x801B121D, text 0xF8) is replaced by the port's own for the real total, in a
box wide enough for it. It is found by its id, so a translation's heading is
rewritten the same way: its "722" becomes the total and its count's width
grows to match (`Cards_Text`). Nine 16-pixel letters fill the console's
box, and a heading that wraps would wait for a page press (the port now
leaves out what does not fit). Three-digit card numbers
(`F8 03` with width 3, Build Deck's list, the trade offers) grow to four or
five digits in the same room. Build Deck's list and the trade screen's scroll
end at the live count (`maximum = 715` was 722 - 7).

**The Library grid.** Its panels are sprite sheets (resource 0/3/n of the
Library package): a stone frame around two rows of big digits that spell
"001" over "100" to "701" over "722". The digit pieces only spell those
ranges (there is no 8 or 9 among them), so with more cards the sections from
701 on get a panel of the port's own
([`library_panels.c`](../src/pc/cards/library_panels.c)): the same frame from
the same texture page, with the plain stone band from between the retail
numbers where the numbers were, drawn through the game's sprite-sheet
renderer for the section rows on screen. The grid itself grows by section
rows of 200 (`CARD_GRID_SECTION_ROW_COUNT`).

## Limits

* Ids stop at 32766 (`CARD_ID_LIMIT`): card ids are signed 16-bit in the
  duel's records and 0x7FFF-masked beside their flags.
* A card defaults to its base's 3D model and effect, with independent `model`
  and `effect` borrowing available. Declarative recipes and code hooks extend
  fusion behavior; equips and rituals use the base's entries unless a mod's
  `equips` or `rituals` rules name the copy ([gameplay tables](gameplay-tables.md)).
  A ritual is still asked for by the retail ritual card whose effect it is.
* The generated name plate is set in a system font, not the retail plates'
  own lettering; a `title` PNG replaces it.
* Copies of Exodia's pieces do not complete Exodia, and Build Deck's one-copy
  rule for the pieces is by id: a copy is another card.
* Legacy numeric sidecars require the original card mods and order for an
  explicit migration. See [API 3 migration](mod-api-3.md); new sidecars use stable identities.
* The Library's panels past section 7 carry no range numbers; the card number
  under the cursor is always shown.

## Checking it

With a save on the memory card (`tmp/morecards` has the harness used): the
Library heading, the grid's last section row and the card view (art, text,
model) of a new card; Build Deck at the end of the chest with 4-digit ids,
adding a new card, saving, and loading it back in a fresh process with the
counts intact; a Free Duel with a deck of new cards (hand images, names,
placement, a guardian star, a direct attack, the opponent's attack, and the
3D battle with a copy's model); a trade of a new card between two memory
cards (`MEMORIES_INPUT2` drives the second pad) with both sidecars rewritten
only after the write; a two-player duel; a save state taken in Build Deck and
resumed in a new process; 5,722 cards; a save with a new card in its deck
loaded without the mod; a card with its own picture, plate, text, type,
level, attribute and stars in the card view and in the duel's hand; and the
Windows build under Wine. Without a card mod
the smoke screenshots are unchanged on both systems.
