# Portable mods: one mod for Windows and Linux

Plan written 2026-09-22. Goal: **a mod author makes one mod and it runs on
both the Windows and the Linux build.** Nobody should have to produce a
`.so` and a `.dll`.

Read first: `notes/modding.md` (the current system), `src/pc/mods/modapi.h`,
`src/pc/mods/mods.c`, `tools/pc/build_game32.py` (`build_mods`, the symbol
table), and the "Windows" section of `notes/pc-build.md` (both builds come
from `./build-pc.sh`, and the Windows one is tested under Wine).

## Where things stand

- **Data-only mods** (`mod.json` plus `data` replacements or patches) have
  no code and already work on both systems. Nothing changes for them.
- **Code mods** are native shared libraries: `mods.c` `dlopen`s
  `<library>.so` on Linux and `LoadLibrary`s `<library>.dll` on Windows
  (`pc/compat/dlfcn.h`). Names bind to the game through `-rdynamic` (Linux)
  or the export table plus `libmemories-pc.a` import library (Windows). So
  every code mod needs two builds, and building a `.dll` needs this repo's
  toolchain.
- The two shipped mods are code mods: `mods/3d-monsters/field_models.c`
  (858 lines) and `mods/hand-camera/hand_camera.c` (67 lines).

## The design in one paragraph

Both builds are 32-bit x86 with the same calling convention, so the machine
code is the same; only the container differs. A code mod becomes **one ELF
relocatable object, `<library>.o`**, which the game loads on both systems
with **its own small loader**: map the sections, resolve undefined names
against a table compiled into the executable, apply the relocations, then
call `MemoriesModInit`. The mod is built against a **mod SDK** with no system
C library (glibc and the Windows CRT disagree about `FILE`, `stdin`, `errno`
and more). What a mod needs from the host comes from the mod API or from a
small, fixed list of C library functions the host supplies. One command,
`tools/pc/build_mod.py`, builds a mod on either system.

What was ruled out, and why:
- **Two native libraries**: what we have now, and the problem.
- **Lua or WebAssembly**: one file, but mods could only reach what we
  expose. 3D Monsters needs the model loader, the GPU banks and the ordering
  table directly.
- **TinyCC in the game, compiling mod source at startup**: needs no
  compiler, but puts a compiler in the game, makes mod code slower, and
  shows compile errors on the player's machine. Revisit only if mod authors
  without a compiler turn out to matter.

## Facts established while planning (check them again, they drift)

- Objects built today use `-fPIC`: relocations include `R_386_GOT32X`,
  `GOTOFF`, `GOTPC` and `PLT32`. Built `-fno-pic` they reduce to `R_386_32`,
  `R_386_PC32` and `R_386_PLT32` (treat that one as PC32). The loader should
  only accept those and refuse anything else with a clear message ("build
  with tools/pc/build_mod.py").
- Undefined symbols of the current mods:
  - **hand-camera**: `D_800E9DB0 D_800F2848 Duel_DrawFieldCards
    gDuel_wSceneStateFlags ViewState_ApplyOrbit`
  - **3d-monsters**: game functions (`func_800540B4`, `Duel_DrawFieldCards`,
    `GsClearOt`, `LoadImage`, `StoreImage`, `SetGeomOffset`...), pinned guest
    data (`D_80010000`, `D_800E9D98`, `gDuel_adwCardStats`... absolute
    symbols), port data and functions (`SoftGpu_Bank`,
    `Memories_GpuCommandWords`, `Memories_GteReadControl`...), and libc:
    `clock_gettime getenv malloc memcpy mmap sqrt strtol vsnprintf` (plus
    `__stack_chk_fail_local`, gone with `-fno-stack-protector`).
- `mmap` is used once, for model arenas at fixed guest addresses
  (`ARENA_BASE 0x90000000`, `ARENA_SIZE 0x40000`, `MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE`).
- The game and psyq headers a mod includes only pull in `<stddef.h>` and
  `<stdint.h>`. Those come with the compiler, so they are safe.
  System-specific includes come from `modapi.h` (`<stdio.h>`, for `FILE *`),
  `pc/compat/mman.h` (`<sys/mman.h>`) and the mods' own `<stdio.h>
  <stdlib.h> <string.h> <math.h> <time.h>`.
- The runtime symbol table (`symbols/<buildid>.txt`, `Symbols_Load`) only
  lists functions and game-section data. It has **no pinned guest symbols**
  and no port data, so it is **not** enough to resolve mods.
- `tmp/pc/llvm-mingw/bin` has `clang` and `ld.lld`. A Windows author can
  build ELF objects with `clang --target=i386-pc-linux-gnu -c`. On Linux,
  `gcc -m32` or the same clang works.

## Progress and verified facts

**Phase 1 done (2026-09-22).**
- `build_game32.py` `write_mod_exports` writes `<build>/mod_exports.c`
  (`src/pc/mods/exports.h`); `Mods_Lookup` in `mods.c` searches it.
  2734 names on Linux, 2750 on Windows. The difference is OS-specific port
  internals (`Win32_*`, `Memories_ContextSwitch`, `Memories_SigProcMask` on
  Windows; `Crash_HandleSignal` on Linux). A mod that binds one of those
  loads on one system only; `build_mod.py` could warn about it.
- `MEMORIES_MOD_EXPORTS=1 memories-pc` prints the table and exits.
  `tools/pc/check_mod_exports.py` compares it against `nm` of the
  executable (sorted, unique, every address matches, and a game function,
  a pinned variable and a port variable are all present). `smoke.py` runs
  it for both builds. Aliases have no symbol of their own on Windows, so 12
  entries there go unchecked.
- With the export table, the only undefined names left in the two mods are
  the C library ones (`clock_gettime getenv malloc memcpy mmap sqrt strtol
  vsnprintf`, plus the PIC and stack-protector ones).
- **Layout (trap 2):** `tools/pc/check_layouts.py` dumps every record in
  every header under `src/` (except `src/pc/platform`, which is port UI
  state) with clang for `i386-pc-linux-gnu` and for `i686-w64-mingw32
  -mno-ms-bitfields`, then compares them. It runs from `./build-pc.sh` (under
  a second). It found three differing records, all `u64` unions:
  `PasswordGlyphCoordinates`, `Pair64` (ygo_types.h) and `SDSEPlayIdPair`
  (sound_effect_request.h). They were aligned to 4 on Linux and to 8 on
  Windows and MIPS. No enclosing header struct was affected, and no
  game-section symbol moved. Fixed in `src/types.h`: on i386 PC builds,
  `s64`/`u64` get `__attribute__((aligned(8)))`. Now 0 differ.
  `ControlCapture` (controls.h, a `uint64_t`) differs too, but it is UI
  state only and is out of scope. Not covered: structs defined inside `.c`
  files, and gcc against clang on Linux (the same ABI, assumed).
- **Struct returns (trap 3):** `-Waggregate-return` over every game and port
  unit finds only `static` helpers in `controls_window.c` and
  `mods_window.c`. No exported function returns a struct by value.

**Phases 2 to 6 done the same day, except for the Windows duel checks below.**
- Phase 2: `src/pc/mods/mod_libc.c` holds the C library list, plus the
  compiler's 64-bit helpers (`__divdi3`, `__udivdi3` and the rest: both
  libgcc and compiler-rt have them). `Mods_Lookup` searches it before the
  export table. Mod API 2 adds `now_us` and `map_fixed`. There is no `env`:
  instead `setting()` reads `MEMORIES_MOD_<ID>_<KEY>` first.
- Phase 3: `src/pc/mods/object_loader.c`. Its test is
  `tools/pc/test_object_loader.py` (ctest `pc_object_loader` for Linux,
  `smoke.py --windows` for Windows), with fixtures in
  `tests/pc/mod_fixtures`. It covers the good object (both call directions,
  data, bss, 64-bit division, narrow returns, a frame over 4 KiB, a call
  from a misaligned stack), six broken objects, and about 35k damaged or
  truncated copies. 37/37 on Linux and under Wine, with the same fixture
  files. Mod functions go to `Symbols_Add`, so a crash reads
  `3d-monsters:say+0x4b`.
- Phase 4: `tools/pc/build_mod.py`, SDK headers in `src/pc/mods/sdk`, and
  `<build>/sdk` (include/, include/libc, tools/build_mod.py, exports.txt)
  beside each game. Mods are built once into `tmp/pc/mod-build` and the
  identical file (same sha256) is copied into both games' `mods/`. (Since
  kept there by a key of everything that goes into the object, as worktrees
  share `tmp/`: `notes/pc-build.md`, "Mod objects".)
- Phase 5: hand-camera needed nothing but dropping `<stdlib.h>`. For 3D
  Monsters: `now_us`, `map_fixed`, tunables moved to settings
  (`MEMORIES_MODS_DEPTH/PIXELS/SCALE/LIFT/PITCH/TEST` are now
  `MEMORIES_MOD_3D_MONSTERS_<KEY>`, or `mod.3d-monsters.<key>` in the
  settings file), and it refuses to start on API < 2. Checked on Linux in a
  duel (`tmp/pc/states/slot1-hand.state`, test mode): ten monsters, the duel
  graphics unchanged, and load times logged.
- Phase 6: the `.so`/`.dll` path, `pc/compat/dlfcn.h`, `-rdynamic`,
  `--export-all-symbols` and the import library are gone. Crash reports never
  used them; they read `symbols/<buildid>.txt`.
- **Duel on Windows under Wine: done (2026-09-22).** The smoke cases
  `duel-3d-monsters` and `duel-hand-camera` reach the first campaign duel
  from boot (New Game, the name "A", CHEST left with Circle, a card set
  face-up with Left) with both mods on, and pass with the same hashes on
  Linux and on the Windows build under Wine: a model stands on the card,
  and L1 turns the field with the hand up. A state saved mid-duel with the
  mods on loads on both systems, and the loaded frame is the same on both.
  What stood in the way:
  - The two builds dealt different hands: a scripted run's clock followed
    the host timer, so loads ended on different frames and the random seed
    (drawn every frame on the name entry screen) parted company. Scripted
    runs now keep time by the game's own waits (platform_common.c).
  - "Backing out with Triangle hung": Triangle in the chest opens the card
    viewer, and Triangle does not close it; Circle does. Nothing hung. The
    viewer's 30 fps frame bound makes Graphics_SyncFrame spin for a VBlank,
    which a scripted run never delivered; it now waits for one
    (`#ifdef MEMORIES_PC` in graphics_frame.c).
  - A Linux state does not load in the Windows build, nor the other way:
    a state holds the native game stack, laid out by another compiler. The
    load now says so instead of "damaged state".
- **Still open:** real Windows once, for the items Wine does not prove.

**More traps, found while doing it:**
- **Stack alignment is two-way.** `-mstack-alignment=4` (the first guess)
  crashed the Linux game: the mod then called Linux host code (SSE2) with a
  misaligned stack. It was a GP fault in `Log_Printf`, reported at address 0.
  `-mstackrealign` fixes it: every mod function aligns to 16 on entry and
  calls out aligned. The loader test calls the mod from a misaligned stack
  and checks alignment in the host; it fails with the old flag.
- **Stack protector.** Arch's gcc turns it on by default, and the canary is
  `%gs:0x14` (Linux TLS). `build_mod.py` and the loader both refuse it.
- **Stack probes.** A frame over 4 KiB must probe on Windows
  (`-fstack-clash-protection`, which gcc and clang both do inline). **Wine
  does not enforce this**: the test passes without the flag, so only real
  Windows can confirm it.
- **Narrow returns** are not a trap. At -O2 both game compilers return a
  `short` with dirty upper bits, and the mod (clang i386-linux) extends it
  itself (`cwtl`). The loader test covers it on both systems.
- A constructor that only sets a static is folded away by clang, so the
  fixture's constructor calls the host.

## ABI traps the SDK must close (each needs a test, not a promise)

1. **Stack alignment.** Linux i386 code may assume a 16-byte-aligned stack.
   Windows only guarantees 4. A mod built for Linux that uses SSE on the
   stack crashes on Windows. The SDK builds with `-march=i686 -mno-sse`
   (x87 floating point, as the game's `-m32` default) and
   `-mincoming-stack-boundary=2` (gcc) / `-mstack-alignment=4` (clang).
2. **64-bit and `double` alignment in structures.** i386 Linux aligns
   `long long` and `double` to 4 inside structs. MinGW (Windows) aligns them
   to 8. `src/types.h` has `s64`/`u64`, used in `ygo_types.h` (the
   `u64 all` union near line 206, `Pair64` near line 1247). A mod built with
   the Linux layout could disagree with the Windows game. Add a layout probe:
   a generated C file of `sizeof`/`offsetof` for every struct in the headers
   the SDK ships, compiled by the Windows compiler, the Linux compiler and
   the mod compiler, with a build check that the three agree. Fix any
   mismatch in the header with an explicit `__attribute__((aligned(N)))` so
   both builds match retail (MIPS also aligns 64-bit to 8). This probe also
   protects the Windows game itself, not only mods.
3. **Structs returned by value.** The SysV i386 ABI returns them through a
   hidden pointer that the callee pops. The Windows ABI returns small ones in
   EAX:EDX. A mod calling a Windows-built function that returns a struct
   would break. The build should list game/port functions returning structs
   by value and refuse to export them, or the SDK marks them
   `__attribute__((ms_abi))`-incompatible. Most likely there are none, so
   confirm.
4. **Bitfields.** The Windows build uses `-mno-ms-bitfields`, so it matches
   GCC's layout. The layout probe covers this too (`GsOT_TAG` is the known
   case).
5. **No system C library in a mod.** Build with `-nostdinc` plus the
   compiler's own include directory (for `stddef.h stdint.h stdarg.h
   stdbool.h limits.h float.h`) and the SDK's `include/`, which declares
   only what the host supplies (below).

## Phase 1: the symbol table mods bind to

- `build_game32.py` writes `mod_exports.c` beside `stubs.c`: a sorted table
  `{ "name", (void *)&name }` of every global a mod may use. That is every
  global function and data object defined by the game units and the port's
  native code, plus every pinned guest symbol (`guest_symbols`). The linker
  fills in the addresses, so it is the same mechanism on both systems, with
  no reliance on `-rdynamic` or `--export-all-symbols`.
- Exclude names a mod must not bind to: the host's C library, the mod
  system's internals, and anything with a `static` twin (the symbol-table
  `#2` names).
- `mods.c` gets `static void *lookup(const char *name)`, a binary search.
- Size check: roughly 10k entries. Fine.
- Test: a CTest that the table is sorted, has no duplicates, and resolves a
  known function, a pinned guest symbol and a port data symbol to the same
  addresses the linker gave them.

## Phase 2: the host C library list

- `src/pc/mods/mod_libc.c`: `{ "memcpy", memcpy }, ...` for a fixed
  allowlist. Proposed: `memcpy memmove memset memcmp strlen strcmp strncmp
  strchr strrchr strtol strtoul snprintf vsnprintf malloc calloc realloc
  free abs sqrt sin cos atan2 fabs floor ceil fmod pow qsort`, plus `fread
  fwrite fseek ftell fclose fgets` for the `FILE *` the host hands out
  (`open_asset`/`open_data`). No `fopen`: files only through the mod API.
  `FILE` stays an opaque type in the SDK.
- `lookup` tries the export table first, then this list. An unknown name
  fails the load with the Mods-window status "needs <name>, which this game
  does not provide".
- Bump `MEMORIES_MOD_API` to 2 and add to `MemoriesModHost` what the mods
  used libc for:
  - `uint32_t (*now_us)(const MemoriesModHost *)`: replaces `clock_gettime`.
  - `void *(*map_fixed)(const MemoriesModHost *, uintptr_t address, size_t
    size)`: replaces the `mmap` of 3D Monsters' arenas. `mods.c`
    implements it with `mmap(MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE)` / `VirtualAlloc`, both
    already behind `pc/compat/mman.h`. Returns NULL if the range is taken.
  - `const char *(*env)(const MemoriesModHost *, const char *name)`: only
    `MEMORIES_*` names, replacing `getenv`. 3D Monsters' tunables are
    debugging knobs. Consider moving them to `host->setting` instead and
    dropping `env`.
  - New entries go at the **end** of the struct, so version-1 fields keep
    their offsets.

## Phase 3: the loader (`src/pc/mods/object_loader.c`)

- Input: an ELF32 `ET_REL` `EM_386` file. Validate everything (header,
  section bounds, symbol and string indexes). This parses untrusted input,
  so it must fail cleanly on bad data rather than crash.
- Allocate each `SHF_ALLOC` section (`.text*`, `.rodata*`, `.data*`,
  `.bss*`) into one block: `mmap` RW on Linux, `VirtualAlloc` RW on Windows.
  Apply relocations. Then make text RX and the rest RW (`mprotect` /
  `VirtualProtect`). Keep it resident for the life of the process, as
  `mods.c` already does for libraries.
- Relocations: `R_386_32` (S + A), `R_386_PC32`/`R_386_PLT32` (S + A - P),
  using the in-place addend (REL, not RELA). Anything else is refused.
- Symbols: defined ones resolve to section base + value. `SHN_COMMON` is
  refused (build with `-fno-common`). Undefined ones go through `lookup`.
  The mod's `MemoriesModInit` is found in its own symbol table.
- Refuse `.init_array`/`.ctors` (no constructors), TLS sections, and
  anything that asks for a GOT.
- Register the mod's function symbols with the crash and hang reporter
  (`src/pc/debug/symbols.c`), so a crash inside a mod reads
  `3d-monsters:draw_frame+0x40` and not a bare address. Optional stretch on
  Linux: the GDB JIT interface (`__jit_debug_register_code`) so gdb sees
  the mod's symbols.
- `mods.c`: `"library": "x"` loads `x.o`. The suffix rule becomes: no
  suffix means `.o`. Drop `LIBRARY_SUFFIX`, `dlopen` and `LoadLibrary` for
  mods. If needed, keep native `.so`/`.dll` loading behind an explicit
  suffix only for development, and delete it once both mods are ported.
- Tests (CTest, both builds): load a small fixture object that calls a
  host function, reads and writes a pinned guest variable, uses
  `.rodata`/`.data`/`.bss`, and calls back through a function pointer. Plus
  negative fixtures: a PIC object, an unknown symbol, a truncated file, a
  COMMON symbol, and a constructor. Each must fail with its own message and
  not crash.

## Phase 4: the SDK and `tools/pc/build_mod.py`

- `build_game32.py` already copies `modapi.h` into `<build>/include`.
  Extend that into an SDK directory shipped beside the game:
  `sdk/include/` holding `modapi.h`, the game and psyq headers mods use (or
  simply `src/` minus `src/pc` internals), and minimal `stdio.h stdlib.h
  string.h math.h` that declare only the phase 2 list, with an opaque
  `FILE`.
- `modapi.h` stops including `<stdio.h>` and uses the SDK's opaque `FILE`.
  Check that the host side still compiles (the host includes the real
  `<stdio.h>` first; guard the typedef).
- `pc/compat/mman.h` must not be reachable from mod code. 3D Monsters
  includes it only indirectly (through `pc/memory.h`?). Find the path and
  break it.
- `tools/pc/build_mod.py <mod dir> [--out DIR]`: finds a compiler (`clang`,
  which on Windows means llvm-mingw's, else `gcc -m32`), compiles every
  `.c` with the fixed flags, and merges them with `ld.lld -r` (or `ld -m
  elf_i386 -r`) into `<library>.o` next to `mod.json`. Flags:
  `--target=i386-pc-linux-gnu` (clang) or `-m32` (gcc), `-std=gnu11 -O2
  -fno-pic -fno-common -fno-stack-protector -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
  -march=i686 -mno-sse -mstack-alignment=4 | -mincoming-stack-boundary=2
  -ffreestanding -nostdinc -isystem <compiler include> -I sdk/include
  -mno-ms-bitfields(n/a on ELF, harmless) -DMEMORIES_PC -D_LANGUAGE_C
  -DLANGUAGE_C`. Optionally strip `.debug*` for release, keeping symbols.
- `build_game32.py`'s `build_mods` calls the same code, so the repo's mods
  and an outside author's are built identically. Build each mod **once**
  and copy the `.o` into both `tmp/pc/game32/mods/` and `tmp/pc/win32/mods/`.
  That proves "one file, both systems" on every build.

## Phase 5: port the existing mods

**hand-camera**: nothing to change in the source except the includes.
- Remove `#include <stdlib.h>` (unused) and `<stdint.h>` (fine to keep; it
  comes with the compiler).
- Its binds (`D_800E9DB0`, `D_800F2848`, `gDuel_wSceneStateFlags`,
  `Duel_DrawFieldCards`, `ViewState_ApplyOrbit`) are all in the phase 1
  table.
- `api = MEMORIES_MOD_API` picks up version 2 on rebuild.

**3d-monsters**:
- `clock_gettime` (lines ~368/417, load timing for the log) becomes
  `host->now_us(host)`.
- `mmap(... MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE ...)` for arenas (line ~447) becomes
  `host->map_fixed(host, ARENA_BASE + i * ARENA_SIZE, ARENA_SIZE)`. Keep
  the "no arena at %p" message.
- `getenv`/`strtol` in `tunable()` (line ~175): move the tunables to
  `host->setting(host, "<key>", fallback)` (they then persist as
  `mod.3d-monsters.<key>` in settings), or use `host->env` if that stays in
  the API. List the tunables and their current `MEMORIES_*` names in the
  commit message so anyone relying on them knows.
- `vsnprintf`, `malloc`, `memcpy`, `sqrt` come from the phase 2 list.
- Includes: drop `<time.h>`. `<stdio.h> <stdlib.h> <string.h> <math.h>`
  now resolve to the SDK's. Break the path to `pc/compat/mman.h`.
- The port data it binds (`SoftGpu_Bank`, `Memories_GpuCommandWords`,
  `Memories_GteReadControl/WriteControl`) must be in the phase 1 table.
  They are port internals, so this mod is tied to the port by design. That
  is fine for a mod the release ships.

**For both**, the acceptance test, on **both** builds (Linux natively,
Windows under Wine, and once on real Windows):
- The mod shows in Game > Mods as loaded, with no status error.
- Hand camera: L1/R1 turn and L3/R3 zoom in a duel with the hand up.
- 3D Monsters: models stand on face-up monsters. The `MEMORIES_TRACE=mods`
  log shows the MODEL.MRG start sector and load times.
- Save state then load with the mods applied: no crash (`reset` hook).
- `python3 tools/pc/smoke.py` and `--windows` still pass (mods off), plus a
  new smoke case with both mods on at a duel frame. It needs an input
  script that reaches a duel. If that is too long, use a save state
  fixture.

## Phase 6: docs and cleanup

- `notes/modding.md`: rewrite "Native mods" as "Code mods". Cover one `.o`
  for every system, `build_mod.py`, the SDK, the libc list, the ABI rules
  (why no system headers), and the trust statement (still native code;
  unchanged).
- Remove the `.dll`/`.so` mod paths from `build_game32.py` (`MOD_IMPLIB`,
  `--export-all-symbols`, `--out-implib`, `-rdynamic`, the DLL link that
  added `guest_symbols.o`), **only once nothing needs them**. `-rdynamic`
  and `--export-all-symbols` may still matter for crash symbolization.
  Check `crash.c`/`symbols.c` before dropping them.
- Keep `pc/compat/dlfcn.h` if anything else uses it; otherwise delete.

## Not in this plan (next, separately)

- **Texture packs from an asset catalog**: data-only, so already portable.
  Someone mapped the WA_MRG/SU art for the static-recomp fork:
  `https://github.com/yamyi/YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesRecomp/blob/feature/asset-manager/src/psx_wa_catalog.c`.
  It has 45 asset families (card art, thumbnails, fields, UI) and matches
  replacements by hashing VRAM uploads. In this port the match point would
  be `LoadImage` (`src/pc/sdk/libgpu.c`). Start with a probe that counts
  which families match here, then add a `"textures"` key to `mod.json`.
- A CI job building both executables on every push. The retail-file
  secrets already exist for the matching build.

## Rules for whoever implements this

- Keep `./build-pc.sh` building both systems. After every phase, run
  `./build-pc.sh`, `python3 tools/pc/smoke.py`, and
  `python3 tools/pc/smoke.py --windows`.
- Wine is not Windows. Before calling phase 5 done, check the mods once on
  real Windows (`tools/pc/run_debug_windows.bat`).
- Record the ABI facts you verify (layout probe results, any struct-return
  functions found) in this file as you go.
- Do not commit without the user asking.
