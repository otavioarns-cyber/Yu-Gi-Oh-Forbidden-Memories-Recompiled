   The types below are deliberately named for this family and are not shared
   with the live map helpers. The inventory rows for both functions warn
   against aliasing this family to those helpers, and the tables are distinct
   symbols in any case: this family reads D_80169E54 and D_8016A278, the live
   path reads gCampaignMap_aLocationTable and D_801695D8. The layouts happen
   to agree because this is a mechanical copy, which is corroboration for the
   offsets below and not a reason to merge the declarations. */

   This merges the two private views the two sources used to carry. The

   saw only the pair at +0x0C, which it copies into the marker object at +0x30
