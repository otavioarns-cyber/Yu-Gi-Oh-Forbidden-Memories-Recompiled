/* Declarations for functions and data that are still generated assembly.
 *
 * These have no defining C translation unit, so there is nowhere for a
 * per-TU header to live and every consumer has been writing its own extern.
 * That is what lets two files disagree about a function nothing in the tree
 * can check. This header is the single place those declarations belong.
 *
 * WHAT GOES HERE
 *
 * A function or global whose status in config/slus_01411/functions.csv is
 * unmatched_asm, once its consumers are known to agree. Build-integrated
 * candidates keep function declarations in the header of the unit they came
 * from: src/candidates/ still gives each of them a defining C translation
 * unit, so that header is a home in the sense this one is not (see the #3859
 * sections at the end). The remaining local function declarations are
 * deliberate disagreements listed below rather than duplication waiting to
 * be moved. `make check-unmatched-contracts` prints the current counts and
 * rejects new unaccounted declaration sites.
 *
 * Hand-written assembly belongs here on the same terms. The status differs but
 * the reason does not: handwritten_asm functions have no defining C
 * translation unit either, so there is nowhere else for a shared declaration
 * to live, and every consumer otherwise writes its own. The primitive handler
 * entry points at the end of this file arrived that way.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT GO HERE, AND WHY THIS FILLS UP SLOWLY
 *
 * Several functions need incompatible declarations because the caller-visible
 * type is what makes code generation match. Those variants still belong here:
 *
 *   SD_SEPlay       (u32, s32, s32), (s32, s32, s32) and (u16, u8, s8)
 *
 * Where a consumer declares no parameters and calls with none, the argument
 * register is not empty. It holds the CALLER'S OWN incoming parameter, still
 * live because nothing clobbered it. That is worth checking per site rather
 * than assuming, because it decides whether the declaration can be fixed:
 *
 *   - model_slot_support.c called func_800540B4 with no argument while $a0
 *     still held its own `index`. Writing that argument explicitly costs
 *     nothing, because the register already holds the value, so the true
 *     one-parameter signature is used there now.
 *
 * So a symbol only moves here once every consumer's spelling is accounted
 * for, and a consumer that cannot state its arguments keeps its local
 * declaration. When a symbol needs different spellings per consumer it gets
 * arms selected by guard #defines, the way input.h and sound.h already do,
 * rather than one flat declaration. Entries are added a few at a time, each
 * gated on the full build. */

/* Two rules for anything added here.
 *
 * A symbol belongs here only while it is genuinely homeless. Once its owning
 * subsystem is understood, move the declaration to that subsystem's header
 * rather than leaving it in this one.
 *
 * When a consumer cannot take the shared declaration because its spelling is
 * load-bearing -- a section attribute deciding gp-relative versus absolute
 * addressing under -G8, a volatile qualifier deciding whether a redundant
 * access survives, or an asm() alias keeping GCC from holding an address
 * across a call -- note the exception beside the declaration so it is not
 * quietly "fixed" later. */

/* Load-bearing caller views that cannot share one flat prototype. Consumers
 * select the declaration they measured before including this header. */

 * and is declared by game/func_800540B4.h. */

/* The five below each have exactly one consumer today, so there is no second
 * spelling to reconcile and nothing was measured away to move them. They are

 * consumer is simply a duplicate that has not happened yet. Each names the
