 * FILE_TRANSFER_STATE_PRIMARY_REQUEST_LOCKED blocks secondary promotion while

 * func_80014308 raises pending, File_StepActiveTransfer submits it and raises
 * busy, and func_80014390 clears busy. The word is only ever read and written
 * whole, and only ever through bit masks. Nothing indexes it, so the
 * `D_8009B0F4[0]` spellings this header replaces were an addressing device
 * rather than evidence of an array.
 *
 * `volatile` is load-bearing on both names, measured rather than assumed:
 * dropping it from the plain name builds a 0x1D0668-byte executable and
 * dropping it from `D_8009B0F4_abs` builds a 0x1D071C-byte one, against the
 * retail 0x1D0800.
 *
 * Two names, one word. The retail image reaches this address both ways. The
 * ready-sector callback in `func_80013C28.c` uses
 * `%gp_rel(D_8009B0F4)($gp)` seven times, while six other generated assembly
 * files use `lui %hi` / `%lo` fifty-nine times. One declaration cannot
 * produce both inside a -G8 translation unit, because the form follows from
 * whether the symbol is small-data eligible. The plain name is, so the
 * assembler resolves it gp-relative; `D_8009B0F4_abs` carries
 * `section(".data")` so it is not, and `c_symbols.ld` ties that name to the
 * same address. Which of the two a unit needs is a property of its compiler
 * profile, not of the word.

 * scalar spellings this replaces reached it as `*(s32 *)(D_800101D8)` and as
 * a plain read, which are the same load.
 *
 * D_800101D8_IN_DATA is a codegen input, measured on each unit separately:
