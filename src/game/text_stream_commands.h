 * branch delay slot. The qualifier preserves access order rather than making
 * a claim about the caller's storage.
 *
 * Text_ExtendGlyphCode and Text_SetStateFromStream both advance one of the
 * byte streams held at the front of the object, chosen by the signed byte at
 * 0x58. Text_ExtendGlyphCode takes TextStreamOwner *, the record that names
 * that array and selector; the command table casts every one of its entries

 * it is the third reader of that selector.
