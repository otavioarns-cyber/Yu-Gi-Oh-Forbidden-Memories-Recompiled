 * 69-70); DuelScene_UpdateDrawPhase assigns the same from `side` and stores `base` at
 * +8 (:154-156), then assigns it again and stores 0xAE at +0xC (:206-207);
 * func_8001B938 assigns `D_800E9F48 + D_8009B1D5 * DUEL_SELECTION_SIDE_SIZE`
 * and stores a halfword at +0xC and bytes at +0x11, +0x12, +0x13, +0x18 and
 * +0x19 (func_8001B938.c:37-42), +0x11 and +0x12 again (:53-54), +0x10
 * (:59) and +0xF (:68), loading it back for each; Duel_GetCardViewerRequestId loads it
 * directly as a DuelCardPickCursor (src/game/duel_selected_card_checks.c); and
 * func_800235C0 loads it into the DuelFieldDisplaySource view that
 * duel_field_display_objects.c already casts the same record to.
 * DuelScene_UpdateHandActions (duel_scene_hand_actions.c) stores it six times
 * and loads it five. Four functions still in assembly, none with a profile in
 * matching_c.json, also store or load it: DuelScene_UpdateCardPlacement.s:32,
 * DuelScene_UpdateFieldActions
 * (stores :56, :613, :753, :1409,
 * :1439; load :1412), DuelScene_UpdateBattle.s (stores :93, :183; load :96) and
 * func_800235C0.
 *
 * DuelCardPickCursor * because that view does cover every store. This
 * note used to say the byte view was the only one that fits, on the
 * grounds that DuelFieldCursor is 0x11 bytes while func_8001B938 writes
 * +0x19. That is true of DuelFieldCursor and false of the record as a
 * whole: DuelCardPickCursor is 0x1A bytes and ends at 0x19 exactly, and
 * duel_card_pick_cursor.h already recorded that its col, row and status
 * agree with the narrower views. Duel_GetCardViewerRequestId now uses this owning type
 * without a cast.
 *
 * The store at +8 stays a cast: it writes a DuelHandSlot *, and giving
 * the record a pointer member there would raise its alignment to 4 and
 * its size to 0x1C, which the asserted 0x1A forbids. Every access in the binary is a %gp_rel lw or sw
 * (Duel_GetCardViewerRequestId.s:6, DuelScene_UpdateStartup.s:94, DuelScene_UpdateDrawPhase.s:38 and :164,
 * func_8001B938.s:12 and its nine loads), so this is the plain declaration.
 * Four bytes at 0x8009B1B4, with D_8009B1B8 at +4 (c_symbols.ld:133-134).
 * Initial value not read. */

 * 1. Afterwards it clears 0x13 on the first record of each side, so the value
 * written in the loop survives only for records 1 to 3.
