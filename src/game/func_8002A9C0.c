/* The update callback func_8002ABB4 installs at 0x4C on the object it
   builds: it fades the object out over its own field_60 countdown, projects
   it, and emits a four-vertex flat polyline (one colour word, length 6)
   and then, with the length cut to 3 and x3/y3 copied into x1/y1, a single
   flat line from the first vertex to the last, both through func_8005B260.
   The record is the canonical DisplayObject.

   The scratchpad side is typed as well: a LINE_F4 at 0x1F8002A0, the four
   SVECTOR corners RotAverage4 projects into its x0..x3, and the
   ProjectionOut func_80041F90 leaves at 0x1F800398. That is load-bearing.
   Written through byte pointers, those stores are not struct references, and
   GCC floats the object's struct-member reads of 0x32 and 0x3E across them
   where the target does not. With both sides typed the plain member reads
   keep their place.

   b0[1].vx and b0[2].vy are b1->vx and b2->vy: the target addresses those
   two stores from the first corner's base, and spelling them through b1 and
   b2 changes the code. */
