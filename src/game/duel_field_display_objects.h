/* One field-grid source record, as func_80023144, func_8002348C and
 * func_800234E4 in duel_field_display_objects.c reach it. The two sources
 * that unit was split across described it twice and disagreed in three
 * places; matched loads and stores settle all three.
 *
 * The DisplayObject pointers at 0x00 and 0x04 are distinct. func_800234E4
 * creates an object and stores it at 0x04; func_80023144 loads 0x00 to place
 * its text box. Whether they ever hold the same object is not established.
 *
 * table_index at 0x17 formerly had two names. func_800234E4 adds it to the
 * side offset to select a graphic, while func_80023144 compares it with 2 and
 * 3 to select a text-box style.
 *
 * The remaining former disagreement was func_80023144's index type. Its
 * definition takes s32; its caller supplies a u8 that promotes to that type.
 *
 * The byte pair at 0x0F/0x10 is also GridCursor's col/row view of the same
 * backing record. func_80023D08 relies on that overlap when it leaves the
 * cursor in $a0 for func_8002348C's settling-move call.
 *
 * func_800235C0 reads the rest: the DisplayLinkEntry array at 0x08 (the
 * same member display_parent_links.h's DisplayParent view names entries,
 * which func_800235C0 passes to DuelSelection_LinkDisplayObjects), the
 * halfword at 0x0C it stores as the panel's y, and the byte at 0x13 it applies with
 * DisplayObject_SetResourceVariant. */
