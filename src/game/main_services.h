/* The per-frame callback registry the resident service pump walks.
 *
 * There are four slots, not one. Main_RunFrameServices calls every non-null
 * slot in order once per frame, and Main_ClearFrameServiceCallbacks clears
 * all four. The size is not a guess: c_symbols.ld places D_800E9DB0 at
 * 0x800E9DB0 and the next symbol, D_800E9DC0, sixteen bytes later, which is
 * exactly four pointers.
 *
 * The main_menu overlay previously declared slot 0 as a bare
 * `void (*)(void)` -- and, where it only cleared the slot, as an `s32`. Both
 * spellings write the right address, because slot 0 sits at
 * the base, but they hide that three more slots follow and that something else
 * may own them. Reaching slot 0 by index says what the code is really doing.
 *
 * This is a registry of independent slots, NOT a chain: no slot is called with
 * arguments, none returns a value, and nothing enforces an order beyond the
 * index. Slot 3 is stored by Duel_InitScene (src/game/duel_init_scene.c:155,
 * `D_800E9DB0[3] = Duel_DrawFieldCards;`; Duel_InitScene.s:207-208), func_8002BFCC
 * (library_runtime.c, `D_800E9DB0[3] = Library_DrawCardGrid;`) and
 * CampaignMap_SetLocation
 * (src/overlays/overworld/set_location.c:56,
 * `D_800E9DB0[3] = CampaignMap_UpdateView;`), and by func_8002ACA4
 * (src/game/library_runtime.c), which clears it when the card view opens and
 * restores Library_DrawCardGrid when it closes.
 * Slot 2 is stored only by func_8002ACA4, which installs func_80029934 for
 * the model view and clears it on the way out; splat's name for that address
 * is D_800E9DB8, and no other listing or C unit names it.
 * Slot 1 is stored by the main_menu overlay, by index:
 * MainMenu_InitTradeScreen (src/overlays/main_menu/trade_update.c,
 * `D_800E9DB0[1] = MainMenu_DrawTradeOffersAndHighlights;`) and
 * MainMenu_ReleaseTradeDisplayHandles
 * (src/overlays/main_menu/trade_offers.c:145, `D_800E9DB0[1] = 0;`). Before
 * that the overlay reached it as D_800E9DB4, with a private declaration in
 * each unit. The per-slot names D_800E9DB8 and D_800E9DBC (0x800E9DB0 + 8
 * and + 12) carry no displacement off D_800E9DB0, so their writers do not
 * appear as `%lo(D_800E9DB0)` references. */

/* The recovery point the registry's comment above already places at
 * 0x800E9DC0. Main_Init arms it with setjmp once the boot sequence is up,
 * and two functions jump back into it: Main_RunGameOver passes 1 from the
 * game-over path and DebugMenu_Exit passes 2, so the value distinguishes
 * which unwound (the first two are now in src/candidates/). All three spell
 * it jmp_buf and include psyq/setjmp.h, which this header now includes so
 * the declaration stands on its own. */

 * c_symbols.ld names D_8009B0A4 one byte on, so no spelling here claims the
 * object is wider than the byte it is.
 *
 * Two arms, because the consumers split on addressing form. func_80013154
 * writes the byte from small data, which is what a scalar reaches at -G8:
 *     sb         $v1, %gp_rel(D_8009B0A3)($gp)
 * (the store at 0x80013224), and that arm is the volatile one. Main_RunDuel
 * and Main_RunCampaignMap write it through index 0 and
 * both want the absolute form, which an array of unknown size reaches at
 * the same -G8:
 *     lui        $at, %hi(D_8009B0A3)
 *     sb         $v0, %lo(D_8009B0A3)($at)

 * words 0A80013C / A3B022A0 at 0x8002D2F8 and 0x8002D350 inside
 * Main_RunCampaignMap.
 *
 * A third arm, `u8 D_8009B0A3[9]`, used to serve
 * src/game/main_run_duel.c. A bound the assembler can see is only
 * needed where its -G sits below the compiler's, which is what
 * duel_terrain_boost.h records for gDuel_bTerrain's [8] under
 * gcc_2_8_1_cc_g8_as_g4_split; both array consumers here are plain
 * gcc_2_8_1_g8, where the incomplete array is already outside small data.
 * Relaxing the [9] to the shared [] leaves the retail SHA-256 unchanged. */
