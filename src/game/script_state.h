 * Script_OpJump and Script_OpJumpIfDeckIncomplete all set the cursor to
 * `D_801A8000 + offset`. All four spelled it `extern u8 D_801A8000[]`, which
 * is the spelling kept here.
 *
 * This is the script engine's view of the address, not a claim to own it.
 * The same buffer is read as 24-byte records through
 * `CardListRowSet D_801A8000[]` in card_list_rows.h, and the overlays reach
 * it as `u32 []` and `MainMenuState []`. None of those files includes this
 * header and none of the four here includes card_list_rows.h, so the
 * spellings never meet.

 * base, which is a different reading from this one. */
