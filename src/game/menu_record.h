typedef struct {
    /* Four DisplayPositionGroup children arrays, packed. Each row is
       the three DisplayPositionChild pointers that type begins with,
       and display_effect_update_callbacks.c hands rows 0 to 3 to
       func_8003A920 as (DisplayPositionGroup *)(p + 0), (p + 0xC),
       (p + 0x18) and (p + 0x24). Four rows of three pointers is 0x30,
       exactly this member's extent.

       The apparent contradiction is worth writing down, because it is
       what makes the reading safe rather than reckless:
       DisplayPositionGroup is 0x38 bytes, so a view based at 0x24
       would run to 0x5C and overrun this 0x4C record. It does not,
       because func_8003A920 touches only children[0..2] -- the first
       twelve bytes -- and never the x/y pair at the type's tail. Only
       DisplayPositionGroup_SetPosition reads that tail, and nothing
       passes it a row.

       Kept as s32 grid[4][3], with the pointer casts written out at
       each use (ILP32, so a slot is exactly one pointer word). The
       converted display_effect_update_callbacks.c reads these words
       through several views: rows go to func_8003A440 and
       DisplayEffect_BuildResourceObjects as DisplayObject ** and to
       func_80039F90 as void **, the
       record itself goes to func_8003A920 as the DisplayPositionGroup *
       for row 0, and single slots such as grid[0][0] and grid[0][1]
       hold DisplayObject pointers. No one element type fits all of
       those users, so the integer slots stay and each user's cast
       states the view it takes. */

       0x40 and 0x42 are the destination the sweep eases toward: it hands
       them to DisplayPositionGroup_SetPosition as the final x and y, and
       subtracts a cosine fraction of 0x44/0x46 from them on the way.
       func_8003AAE4 uses 0x40 differently -- a 0..0x80 fade ramp it steps by
       D_8009B0D8 * 8 -- so neither reading governs and the offsets stay the
       names.

       0x44 and 0x46 are the distance still to travel: the sweep seeds them
       with 0x40 - 0x34 and 0x42 - 0x36 on its first tick.

       0x48 is the eased angle, running to TRIG_ANGLE_QUARTER_TURN, and 0x4A
       the per-tick step derived from it, whose sign picks which end of the
       cosine the sweep starts from.

       Signed, because the sweep compares 0x4A against zero and passes 0x40,
       0x42, 0x44 and 0x46 through s16 casts. The sites that want the
       unsigned load spell it `*(u16 *)&record->field_40`, which keeps the
       lhu the target issues there and still names the field. */
