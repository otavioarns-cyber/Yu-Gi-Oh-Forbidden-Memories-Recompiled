 * display_object_core.c's renderer view (+0x17, +0x30, +0x3C, +0x5C). Every
 * offset they share agrees; each named a different subset.
 *
 * That exception is now resolved. display_object_core.c and

 * display_object_core.c stores with single word writes. Splitting those
 * words outright would have turned an sw into an sh; carrying each as a

 * renderers now take this record.

 * display_object_config.h's separate halfword view names that were still
 * word-only here. All four of the offsets that view exists for -- 0x30, 0x3C,

       DisplayObject_RenderGouraudQuadList and
       DisplayObject_RenderTexturedGouraudQuadList copy it into a primitive's
       colour word.

       Halves: DuelEffect_UpdateObjectLayout writes 0x38 and 0x3A as an x/y
       pair. That function writes six such pairs at stride 8 -- 0x28, 0x30,
       0x38, 0x40, 0x48, 0x50 -- of which the record already had a halfword
       view for four.

       That is one witness under one object kind, and this halfword has more
       readings than almost any other on the record, so it does not
       generalise. The stride-0xC run above and the stride-8 colour run at
       0x2C both cross this range and disagree with it. So, separately, do
       the three views that already name these halves outside this header:
       DisplayObjectVelocity in display_object_helpers.c calls 0x36, 0x38 and
       0x3A velocity_x, velocity_y and velocity_z and adds them to 0x30/0x32
       every frame, while DisplayObjectSnapshot in DisplayObject_SavePosition.h and
       DisplayObjectPosition in display_object_interpolation.h read the same
       0x36/0x38 pair as a saved position that eases into the live one.
       display_object_helpers.h sets out at length why neither of those
       generalises either.

       Five readings, no winner, so the halves are named for their offsets
       and nothing more -- the same grounds 0x44 and 0x4C keep theirs on. A
       consumer that knows which motion path owns its object should take the
       view that names what it means, as name_entry_runtime.c does with
       the velocity one. */

       0x44 is the fourth of six words at stride 8 -- 0x2C, 0x34, 0x3C, 0x44,
       0x4C, 0x54 -- which display_object_helpers.c zeroes in one run. For a
       gouraud-rendered object those six are per-vertex colours:
       DisplayObject_RenderTexturedGouraudQuadList, the twelve-word code-0x3C
       renderer, copies 0x44 into its third vertex's colour word, and
       Dialog_UpdateChoice writes all six with colour constants (0x2000 four
       times, 0xC000 twice) before installing Widget_UpdatePulseColour as the
       update callback.

       The sprite emitters read the same word as a scale instead:
       DisplayObject_RenderSpriteList and DisplayObject_RenderSpriteStrips assign it to sprite_primitive.h's u32
       `scale`, and display_object_transition.c animates the two halves from a
       0x1000 base, with that file and display_object_core.c resetting the
       pair to 0x10001000 -- 1.0 in each half of 12-bit fixed point.

       An earlier revision of this comment, from #2985, gave only the second
       reading and called 0x44 "the scale". That generalised one witness, which
       is the mistake display_object_config.h avoids for 0x6A. Both readings
       are recorded here because the record is shared across object kinds and
       neither one governs.

       The union itself is unaffected: it asserts that some users take the word
       and others the halves, which is true under either reading, and it is the
       same device as 0x40 and 0x48 on either side. */

       display_object_helpers.c zeroes in one run.

       For a gouraud-rendered object it is a vertex colour:
       DisplayObject_RenderGouraudQuadList and
       DisplayObject_RenderTexturedGouraudQuadList copy it into a primitive's
       colour word, Dialog_UpdateChoice writes 0x2000 and func_800391E4 writes
       0xA0A0A0.

       For others it holds a second callback: display_object_updates.c calls
       through it as void (*)(u8 *, s32), and dialog_transition.c,
       src/game/duel_init_scene.c and func_8002ABB4.c each store a
       function's address here.

       Neither reading governs, so the offset is the name. s32 is the spelling
       that serves both: the callback writers in this file already cast the
       function to it, and a colour word is not a pointer. DuelCardDisplayObject
       in duel_card_display_state.h names the same word field_4C, as a void *,

       object here and Duel_DrawLifePointsAndDeckCounts loads it back.
       DisplayObject_InitializeTexturedGouraudQuad in display_object_helpers.c writes the colour 0x00808080,
       as the fourth of six words at stride 0xC -- 0x2C, 0x38, 0x44, 0x50,
       0x5C, 0x68. That is
       a different run from the stride-8 one described at 0x4C, and the two
       agree only at 0x2C and 0x44, which is why neither run's reading can be
       pushed onto the whole tail. DisplayObjectStream_ConfigureRotation
       advances it by 4; display_object_stream_read_next_command.c adds the halfword at 0x58 to form a
       byte pointer, the reading DisplayObjectStreamState spells as `current`;
       and the two DisplayObject_Render*GouraudQuadList functions copy it into
       a primitive word.

       s32 serves all of them: a word load and store do not distinguish
       signedness, and the pointer writers cast, as they already do at 0x4C. */

       user the comment above lists, and the two callers that reach the word

/* Two functions reach past this record, and it is not a mistake in
   either of them, so do not "fix" the size to accommodate them
   without settling what follows.

   The 0x70 stride is not merely asserted, it is fixed by the layout:
   D_800EFE48 holds DISPLAY_OBJECT_POOL_CAPACITY (96) entries, and
   0x800EFE48 + 96 * 0x70 is 0x800F2848, which is exactly where
   D_800F2848 begins. There is no room for a larger record.

   Yet DisplayObject_RenderTexturedGouraudQuadList walks this pool with that
   stride and then tests e[0x72] as a flag, reading a second vertex set from
   0x58, 0x64, 0x68 and 0x6C when it is set; and
   DisplayObject_InitializeTexturedGouraudQuad in display_object_helpers.c writes object[0x72]. Both
   land two bytes past the record, which is `next` of the following
   entry.

   What that means is not established here. The sibling renderer
   DisplayObject_RenderGouraudQuadList gates its second submission on
   e[0x5A] instead, so the two list heads (D_800EFE38[4] and [5]) may simply
   carry differently shaped payloads. Recorded as an open question rather
   than guessed at.

   Neither reach stops the file converting. e[0x72] stays a byte reach,
   ((u8 *)e)[0x72], the spelling DisplayObject_InitializeTexturedGouraudQuad already uses for the
   identical write, and the second vertex set is reached from the members
   its words begin at: *(s32 *)&e->field_58, &e->field_64 and so on.

   What the earlier wording here called the real obstacle -- a member read
   is a struct reference, the scratchpad stores it sits between are not, and
   GCC 2.8.1 floats the load across them -- is real, but it constrains the
   spelling of a read and not whether the read can be named. The scratchpad
   in both renderers is a libgpu primitive, set up with setlen/setcode as
   POLY_G4 (8, 0x38) and POLY_GT4 (12, 0x3C), and every store into it is a
   store to one of that primitive's members. A read taken through the
   member's address, *(s32 *)&e->field_2C, stays a scalar reference as the
   old (u8 *) offset did, so the target keeps it after the store before it;
   a read that no scratchpad store precedes can be an ordinary member read.
   That is the same device duel_card_frame_draw.c uses for its 0x0C colour word, and
   it is how the two DisplayObject_Render*GouraudQuadList functions name
   every offset they touch except 0x72. */
