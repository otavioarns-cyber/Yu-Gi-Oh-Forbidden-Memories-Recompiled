/* The motion view of a display object: a position triple at 0x30 with its
 * three 8.8 fraction bytes at 0x62, and a per-frame delta triple at 0x36.
 *
 * 0x36/0x38 is read two ways across the tree, and this is the second of them.
 * DisplayObject_SavePosition.h's DisplayObjectSnapshot and display_object_interpolation.h's
 * DisplayObjectPosition both treat the pair as a *saved* or *source* position
 * that eases into the live pair at 0x30/0x32. Here the same halfwords are
 * added to the position every frame, which is only meaningful as a velocity.
 *
 * Neither view is wrong and neither generalises: the memory belongs to
 * whichever motion path owns the object, exactly as 0x44 and 0x4C in
 * display_object.h are a colour to one renderer and a scale or a callback to
 * another. name_entry_runtime.c settles this reading for the objects
 * it drives -- it accelerates 0x38 toward 0x800 by 0x40 a frame through
 * DisplayObject_StepToward, decays 0x36 toward zero by 8 through
 * DisplayObject_StepTowardZero, then calls DisplayObject_StepPositionXY.
 * That is gravity, friction and integration, in that order. */
