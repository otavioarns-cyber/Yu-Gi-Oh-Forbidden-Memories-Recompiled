/* Duel scene-state 4, the hand navigation and card play phase, and the state
 * private to it. DuelScene_UpdateHandActions (duel_scene_hand_actions.c) is
 * the only source in the tree that names any of the three globals below;
 * duel_scene_callbacks.c takes the prototype for the phase callback table.
 *
 * Every access to all three is gp-relative in retail: 5, 3 and 4 relocations,
 * none through %hi/%lo. So these are the plain scalar declarations. That the
 * distinction is real rather than an artefact of the pattern is visible in
 * the same function, where D_800EAE88 is reached through %hi/%lo and
 * gp-relatively never.
 *
 * A fourth byte the function uses, the scripted path's target slot at
 * 0x8009B20A, is not here: it falls inside D_8009B208[8], which
 * duel_scene_resume.h already declares, and the unit reads it as
 * D_8009B208[2].

/* Whether the scripted path has a card to stack onto the hand. The AI step
 * clears it, and raises it when the selection's field1 byte D_800EAE88[1] (ai.h)
 * is non-zero; the following step keeps bit 0 and tests the result, and the
 * delayed step tests bit 0 again to decide whether the hand-stack child is
 * spawned.
 *
 * The two loads are lhu and the three stores are sh. Both reads are masked
 * with 1, and GCC loads unsigned for a mask that discards the sign, so the
 * declared sign does not show in the object code and the stores cannot settle
 * it either; s16 is kept from the declaration the unit matched with. The next
 * named symbol is D_8009B1A0, two bytes on, so the declared width fills the
 * gap exactly. */

 * scripted step sets it to -1 through a signed lvalue cast, and each following
 * step pre-increments it and reads D_800EAE88 at the new index, so the walk
 * starts at the list's first entry.
 *
 * Declared u8, as the private declaration had it: the single load is lbu and
 * the two stores are sb, and the signed views are casts at the use sites --
 * the arrangement duel_hand.h records for D_8009B1EC, where the declaration
 * stays unsigned and the cast at the use is what keeps the signed read. The
 * gap to the next named symbol is six bytes, and D_8009B1E4 below sits inside
 * it, so that gap is not evidence of a wider object. */
