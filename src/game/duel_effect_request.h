/* The record DuelEffect_CreateRequest hands a duel effect handler.
 *
 * DuelEffect_AllocateRequest is where the layout comes from: it takes a free entry from
 * DuelEffect_FindFreeRequest and fills every field below, so each one is a store in the
 * function rather than a guess. It zeroes +0x00, +0x02, +0x04 and
 * +0x12, writes 8 at +0x10, the effect id at +0x18, zero at +0x1A, the shared
 * buffer D_80010000 + 0x3800 at +0x14, two words copied out of D_800E9D90 at
 * +0x08 and +0x0C, 0x80 at +0x1C and zero at +0x1D.
 *
 * The three halfwords at +0x00, +0x02 and +0x04 are the request's payload and
 * their meaning is the effect id's business, not the record's, which is why
 * they are not named here. Two callers disagree about them and both are
 * right for their own id: DuelEffect_StartSwords (id 0x12) writes 0xA0/0x78
 * into +0x00 and +0x02, the centre of a 320x240 screen, while
 * DuelScene_UpdateResume (id 0xB) and duel_trap_resolution.c (id 8) copy a card
 * record's +0x30/+0x32/+0x34 triple straight into all three, and
 * DuelEffect_ApplyHarpiesFeatherDuster (id 0x17) reads +0x04 back as a y
 * coordinate. Naming the pair
 * x/y, which two of the private copies did, asserts the first reading over
 * the others. */

/* Request flags are a complete lifecycle contract. DuelEffect_AllocateRequest
 * raises ACTIVE when it allocates an entry and DuelEffect_FindFreeRequest uses
 * that bit to find a free one. DuelEffect_UpdateRequests raises INITIALIZED
 * immediately before the first handler call and clears the whole byte when the
 * handler reports completion.
 * NONBLOCKING excludes long-running field effects from the pool's blocking
 * status while still dispatching them normally.
 *
 * The request pool's status byte below is separate. DuelEffect_CreateRequest
 * raises bit 7 when it hands out a request and DuelEffect_ResetRequestPool
 * clears the byte; DuelEffect_UpdateRequests clears bit 0, raises it again
 * while walking blocking records and returns it; DuelScene_Update drops bit 7
 * unless bit 0 is set;
 * DuelEffect_ApplyRaigeki, DuelEffect_ApplyStatPenalty and
 * DuelEffect_ApplyDarkPiercingLight test bit 0. Read lbu everywhere and one
 * byte wide (c_symbols.ld names D_8009B261 next). Retail reaches it through
 * $gp in DuelEffect_UpdateRequests, DuelEffect_CreateRequest and
 * DuelEffect_ResetRequestPool, and through %hi/%lo in DuelScene_Update,
 * DuelEffect_ApplyRaigeki, DuelEffect_ApplyStatPenalty,
 * DuelEffect_ApplyDarkPiercingLight and DuelScene_UpdateExodiaResult. The
 * matching coordinator, duel_card_effects.c, and the matching Exodia-result
 * source define the .data arm below for that. The request-creation source
 * takes the plain arm.
 *
 * This paragraph named duel_scene_update.c until 2026-09-12. That was true
 * when it was written: duel_scene_update.c defined the arm from #3231 until
 * the coordinator moved through a candidate and then returned to matching C.
 *
 * What the arm buys DuelScene_UpdateExodiaResult is measured rather than
 * assumed: retail
 * leaves the delay slot before that unit's request-status test empty, and the
 * bare form this arm produces is one pseudo-instruction to the delay-slot
 * filler, so there is nothing for it to hoist into the slot. The unsized
 * array the unit declared privately gives cc1psx's own splittable pair
 * instead, and the lui half lands in the slot. */
