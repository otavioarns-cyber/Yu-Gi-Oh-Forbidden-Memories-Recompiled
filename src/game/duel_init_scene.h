/* The duel entry point, and the two banner display objects it builds.

   Duel_InitScene allocates both from DisplayObject_AcquireSlot and hands each to
   DisplayObject_SelectOrderingTable1, whose parameter is DisplayObject *, which is what #3176
   established and what DuelScene_UpdateResultOutro's source already declared. The
   other consumers use the typed view. The Exodia candidate takes the guarded
   byte-pointer arm because its offset-based accesses are codegen-sensitive.

   The prototype is the one main_run_duel_and_library.c held as its own
   extern, which was the only declaration anywhere. */
