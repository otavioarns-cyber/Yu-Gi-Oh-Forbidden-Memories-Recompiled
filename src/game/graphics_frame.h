/* The per-frame step multiplier. graphics_frame.c sets it to D_8009B0C1 + 1
 * once a frame and Main_Init (src/game/main_init.c) seeds it at 1;
 * every other consumer scales a motion delta by it, which is why a dropped
 * frame moves things twice as far.
 *
 * It is one four-byte value, and the three widths seen in the listings come
 * from the use sites rather than the declaration. The resident listings carry
 * eighteen accesses across twelve functions, every one of them at offset
 * zero: thirteen word, three halfword, two byte, with func_80012DB4 in two of
 * those groups. That census is the resident one; the main_menu overlay adds a
 * nineteenth access, a halfword read at offset zero --
 * `lhu $a0, %lo(D_8009B0D8)($v0)` at
 * src/candidates_target/main_menu/func_80180390.S:217.
 * gcc 2.8.1 picks the narrow load itself -- `(u8)` and `(u16)` on an
 * int global emit lbu and lhu against the same symbol -- so a narrow read is
 * written as a cast at the site, not as a declaration.
 *
 * The two arms left select addressing and ordering, which a cast cannot:
 *
 *   _IS_VOLATILE -- Main_Init seeds it and must not have the store folded;
 *                   display_object_fade_callbacks.c takes it for the whole
 *                   unit, and its three plain reads build the same under it
 *   _IN_DATA     -- out of small data at the compiler */

/* The movie playback state byte, shared by three files that disagree about
 * how to reach it.
 *
 * movie_playback_control.h describes what it means: Movie_Play sets bit
 * 0x80 when a movie starts, func_800359B0 sets 0x40 once the stream has been
 * asked to stop and clears 0x80 when it has, and Movie_ResetPlaybackState
 * clears the byte. graphics_frame.c reads bit 0x80 in the frame loop, which is
 * why it is declared here -- this is the header all three consumers already
 * include, and main_run_frontend_loop.c does not include movie_playback_control.h at
 * all.
 *
 * Two arms, for the same reason D_8009B0D8 below has them. Every consumer is
 * in the -G8 family, where a byte-sized global is reached %gp_rel by default.
 * main_run_frontend_loop.c and graphics_frame.c both carry section(".data") to escape
 * that; movie_playback_control.c takes the plain spelling and wants the
 * gp-relative form. Each arm reproduces exactly what that file already
 * wrote. */
