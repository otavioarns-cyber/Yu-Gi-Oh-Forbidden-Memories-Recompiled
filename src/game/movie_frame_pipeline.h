/* The pipeline's state block, 0x8009B060 to 0x8009B073 in one run, plus the
 * two stream fields after it. Every symbol below was declared identically by
 * each of its users and none is named outside this family.
 *
 * The eight bytes are flags and small counters: D_8009B060 is set from
 * func_8005B8A0's argument and gated on, D_8009B064 is cleared on start,
 * set by Movie_StartFadeOut and read by the fade path, and D_8009B062 is the
 * frame-decoded latch that the DecDCTout callback func_8005C1F4 raises and
 * mdec_sync.c's Movie_WaitFrameDecoded waits on and clears.
 * D_8009B068, D_8009B06C and D_8009B070 are the three words that follow.
 *
 * D_8009B498 is the VLC buffer -- func_8005B8A0 points it at D_80010000 and
 * DecDCTvlcBuild is handed it -- and D_8009B49C is the stream position, copied
 * from a CdlLOC and passed on by address. This header now includes
 * psyq/libcd.h for that type rather than relying on its consumers having done
 * so; mdec_sync.c had not.
