/* Guardian Stars as mods change them (notes/modding.md, "Guardian Stars").
 *
 * A mod's manifest may carry "guardian_stars": the stars' names and icons,
 * new stars past the disc's ten (up to the card record's 4-bit fields), and
 * the matchup table: for each ORDERED pair (the attacker's star, the
 * defender's star) one signed adjustment, which is exactly what
 * Duel_CalcGuardianStarMatchup returns (the disc's +500, -500 or 0). The
 * duel adds it to the left comparison value, as it adds the disc's.
 *
 *   "guardian_stars": {
 *       "stars": [ {"id": 11, "name": "Fire", "icon": "icons/fire.png",
 *                   "beats": ["Grass"]} ],
 *       "matchups": [ {"attacker": 1, "defender": 2, "bonus": 1000,
 *                      "mirror": true} ],
 *       "default_bonus": 500,
 *       "replace": false,
 *       "choice": "ask"
 *   }
 *
 * Everything left out stays the disc's. Without a mod nothing here decides
 * anything and the game's own arithmetic runs. Read once, the first time
 * anything asks (the cards name stars while they are built), in the order
 * the mods load; where two mods set the same pair the later one wins. */
