/* Card packs (booster packs): what mods declare and how a pack is opened
 * (notes/card-packs.md).
 *
 * A mod's manifest may carry "packs", a list of packs -- or the name of a
 * file of the mod that holds them -- and "pack_shop", the rules of the shop
 * they are sold in. The packs of every applied mod add up, as the starter
 * decks do; "pack_shop" is the last mod's in the load order, and its "shops"
 * add up by id. Everything is read once, from Cards_Build, and needs a
 * restart like the other tables.
 *
 * This part knows nothing of the screen (pack_shop.h): it reads the
 * manifests, checks them, and deals a pack from a stream of random numbers.
 * A pack always spends PACK_DRAWS_PER_SLOT numbers a slot, whatever it
 * holds, so a replay of the same input deals the same cards and spends the
 * same numbers: a guarantee, the pity, "unique_in_pack" and "max_copies"
 * choose among the numbers already drawn rather than drawing more.
 *
 * The FM Editor's Simulate (tools/pc/fm_editor/packs.py) is this dealer
 * again in Python; tests/pc/packs_golden.txt holds what both deal for the
 * same numbers.
 *
 * With no pack declared, nothing here is asked and nothing changes. */
