/* More cards than the disc has (notes/more-cards.md).
 *
 * A mod's "cards" adds cards after the 722 retail ones. Each new card is a
 * copy of a retail card, its *base*: it has the base's artwork, 3D model,
 * card text, fusions, equips and effect, and its own ATK, DEF, type,
 * guardian stars, level, attribute and, optionally, name. The disc has none
 * of these cards, so wherever the game goes to the disc or to a table laid
 * out by the disc it asks for the base instead (Cards_BaseId).
 *
 * The tables the game indexes by card id (stats, level and attribute, the
 * name sort key) and the workspaces sized by the number of cards live with
 * the game's own variables (src/pc/game/card_storage.c), so save states
 * carry them. What a save holds of the new cards -- how many the player owns
 * and whether the Library has seen them -- has no room in the memory card's
 * block, so it is kept beside it in the user directory, by duelist code and
 * save sequence (cards.c).
 *
 * An entry with "replace" in place of "copy" changes a retail card itself:
 * its stats in the tables, and its own name, text and artwork here, which
 * the game's lookups of the retail ones (Text_Resolve) then give. */
