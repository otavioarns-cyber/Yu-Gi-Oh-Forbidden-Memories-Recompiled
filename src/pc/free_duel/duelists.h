/* More duelists than the disc has (notes/more-duelists.md).
 *
 * A mod's "duelists" adds opponents after the retail thirty-nine. Each new
 * duelist is a copy of a retail one, its *base*: it has the base's portrait,
 * deck pool, drop pools and AI, and its own name. The disc has none of these
 * duelists, so wherever the game goes to the disc, or to a table the disc laid
 * out, it asks for the base instead (Duelists_BaseId) -- the same shape
 * cards.h uses for cards past the disc's 722, and for the same reason.
 *
 * What the base gives is then edited with the tables a mod already has
 * (pc/cards/tables.h): "drops" and "decks" name an added duelist as readily
 * as a retail one, so a new opponent with a deck of its own is a "duelists"
 * entry and a "decks" entry for it.
 *
 * An entry may instead "replace" one of the disc's own, and then its name,
 * face, way of playing and unlock go over that duelist rather than making a
 * new one. Where the disc is read never changes -- a replacement is still its
 * own base -- so its deck and drops are edited the way any duelist's are.
 * Two mods replacing the same one are settled as an edited pool is: the last
 * to name it has it.
 *
 * An added entry may ask for a "slot", the id it wants, which is its place on
 * the grid: page slot / 40, cell slot % 40. Slots are handed out once every
 * mod has been read, explicit ones first, so an entry that asked for a place
 * is never beaten to it by one that would have taken anything. Two asking for
 * the same slot are settled by load order the other way from a replacement:
 * the earlier keeps it and the later takes the next free place, since moving
 * the duelist already there would rearrange a roster its own mod laid out. A
 * slot nothing was placed in is no duelist: Duelists_Valid says so and its
 * cell stays empty.
 *
 * Ids are 0 for the Free Duel screen's Deck Build entry and 1 up for
 * opponents, as gDuel_bOpponentID and Tables_DuelistNames number them.

 *     "story":  a campaign story flag, as the disc's own unlocks use
 *     "card":   a card the trunk or deck must hold -- an id, a name, or an
 *               identity
 *     "copies": how many of "card" (1 by default)
 *   }
 *
 * Nothing is stored: a condition is read from the save's own records, trunk
 * and flags every time the screen opens, so it follows the save that is
 * loaded and needs no migrating. `state` is a SaveDataState, as
 * Duelists_RecordSlot takes.
