/* Where the port's files live. Two roots:
 *
 *  - the program directory, which holds the executable and the mods shipped
 *    with the release; nothing is ever written there (outside user/ in
 *    portable mode, below);
 *  - the user directory, which holds everything the player owns: settings,
 *    controls, save slots, save states, screenshots, their own mods and
 *    whatever a mod stores. On Windows that is
 *    Documents\My Games\YFM Re-Decomp; elsewhere $XDG_DATA_HOME/YFM Re-Decomp
 *    (~/.local/share/YFM Re-Decomp). A file named portable.txt in the
 *    program directory makes it user/ there instead (portable mode).
 *    MEMORIES_USER_DIR names another and wins over both. When that folder
 *    has no saves but saves/ beside the game does (where the port keeps
 *    everything when it cannot make the folder), what is there is copied
 *    in, and used where it is only when it cannot be.
