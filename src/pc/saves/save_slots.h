/* Save slots: the port's saves, one file per slot, instead of memory cards.
 *
 * Slot n is saves/slotNN.sav in the user directory (paths.h). A slot file is
 * byte for byte the 8 KiB block the game writes to a memory card: the
 * 0x200-byte title/icon header, the 0x680-byte save state and its 0x680-byte
 * duplicate, then zeros. So a slot can go back onto a card image with any
 * memory card manager, and a card's save can become a slot.
 *
 * After both copies, at SAVE_SLOT_TAG_OFFSET, the port keeps a token of its
 * own in what is otherwise zero padding: a number drawn afresh each time the
 * slot is saved. What a save holds of the cards mods add is kept beside it
 * under that token (cards.h), so two slots of one duelist never share it.
 *
 * The first time the saves directory is created, the save on each memory
 * card image the older builds used (memcard1.mcd, memcard2.mcd) is copied
 * into slots 1 and 2. The card images are only read.
 *
 * Nothing here touches game memory; the caller passes the game's integrity
 * check in, so the storage can be tested on its own. */
